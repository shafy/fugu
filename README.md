## Get Fugu
There are two ways to use Fugu: Self-hosting or Fugu Cloud (managed version by us as a SaaS). 

If you don't have the strict need to host Fugu on your own premises, we recommend using Fugu Cloud. It costs $9/month, and you don't need to worry about managing your own version, updating, etc.

Our servers are located in the EU (Germany), and your data doesn't leave the EU. We don't track any personal data. Read more in our [privacy policy](https://fugu.lol/legal/privacy).

Head over to [our website](https://fugu.lol) to sign up and get started super duper fast.
